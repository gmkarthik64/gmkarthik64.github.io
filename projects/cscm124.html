<h1>CSCM124 Final Project</h1>

<h2>Project Info</h2>
I worked on a haplotype assembly project which involved sequencing haplotypes from reads. The problem is as follows:<br/>
To sequence haplotypes, reads are made from regions of haplotypes and combined to reassemble the haplotype. The issue is that humans have 2 haplotypes per chromosome (and plants have more), but each read comes from only one haplotype and we do not know which one. The goal is to determine which haplotype each read came from, so they can be correctly reassembled.<br/>
For my project, I decided to deal with the case of up to 4 haplotypes and combining the reads while also seeing how increasing the lengths of reads affected the accuracy in determining the original haplotypes.<br/>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<h2>Project Goal</h2>
By the end of the quarter, I wanted to create 3 algorithms: a brute force, greedy, and a more optimized algorithm that would be more accurate than the greedy one, though likely slower. I achieved this by adding a hill-climbing search to my algorithm in order to find solutions similar to the one the greedy alogrithm returned but more fitting of the haplotype reads.

<h2>Weekly Progress</h2>
<b>Week 5</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Generate haplotype data to later create read matrices from and compare to solutions generated by algorithms. (Achieved)<br/>
Weekly Grade: A<br/>
Next Week Goal: Create matrix of reads and a brute force algorithm to check all possible haplotypes against the read matrix to find the best solution.<br/>
Problems: No problems<br/>
<br/>
<b>Week 6</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Create matrix of reads and a brute force algorithm to check all possible haplotypes against the read matrix to find the best solution. (Incomplete)<br/>
Weekly Grade: B/C<br/>
Next Week Goal: Create brute-force algorithm and greedy-algorithm.<br/>
Problems: Did not finish brute-force algorithm, because generating the read matrix had some unexpected complexity due to trying different methods such as adding gaps in reads or just randomly selecting which SNPs to be shown for each read.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Week 7</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Create brute-force algorithm and greedy-algorithm. (Achieved)<br/>
Weekly Grade: A<br/>
Next Week Goal: Write tests for time/accuracy for each algorithm.<br/>
Problems: The main problem was testing the brute-force algorithm as it would take exponential time and was impossible to test effectively for 3 or 4 haplotypes due to this run-time<br/>
<br/>
<b>Week 8</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Write tests for time/accuracy for each algorithm. (Achieved)<br/>
Weekly Grade: A<br/>
Next Week Goal: Come up with improvement on greedy algorithm.<br/>
Problems: The only problem was determining the best way to test accuracy (such as hamming distance or switch distance) and in the end I chose to use hamming distance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Week 9</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Come up with improvement on greedy algorithm. (Achieved)<br/>
Weekly Grade: A<br/>
Next Week Goal: Any optimizations to the code (especially the hill-climbing search) to try and gain speed or accuracy.<br/>
Problems: No Problems. Implementing a hill-climbing search algorithm worked more easily than expected and did not take too long to debug.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Week 10</b><br/>
Goal of the week: Any optimizations to the code (especially the hill-climbing search) to try and gain speed or accuracy.<br/>
Weekly Grade: B<br/>
Next Week Goal: N/A<br/>
Problems: I cleaned up some inefficient part of the code but did not really come up with a way to fundamentally improve the hill-climbing search.<br/>
